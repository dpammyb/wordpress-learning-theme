        <!-- this next line is a little hard to read. We are asking Wordpress to
             print the web address (URI) of the directory where our stylesheets live.
             Then we add "/style.css" to the end of the href value.  This will result in
             an HTML line  that looks something like:
             <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://hackinghistory.ca/wp-content/themes/Wordpress-learning-theme/style.css">
             (because the php will run and insert the results of the command into the file.

             more info here: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_template_directory_uri/

             Note: the proper way to add stylesheets is actually somewhat different, and
             involves using another file, called functions.php. But this theme is simple we
             don't even have that file at all!

             probably use a class that is commonly used in the big web frameworks, like bootstrap
             or foundation, so that we could leverage their massive advantages.-->
        <div id="page">
            <!-- here we use an id; again, we do this so we can address it with css in style.css -->

                 notice how none of these tags is actually closed.
                 that's because the closing all happens in footer.php-->
